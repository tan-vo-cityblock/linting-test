# Cityblock Abstractions

Abstractions of concrete concepts used to describe the operations performed by a Cityblock within our data architecture. Each folder should represent one domain, with each `abs_` model representing one abstraction. For each abstraction there can be multiple feature models (`ftr_`) that provide additional pieces of logic for the abstraction. For each domain there are additional aggregation models (`agg_`) that provide facts aggregated from the abstractions contained within the domain.
