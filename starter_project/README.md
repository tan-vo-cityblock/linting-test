[Mixer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeTrkLia0tVeJ4Li_iEMyGG-cS0xUUHHTUP0quEkgVY/edit#slide=id.g4ba398b299_0_126)
is... *a brand*. Itâ€™s the catch-all term for a collection of processes that ingest and transform different kinds of data, from external sources, as well as from Commons itself.
The name came from the idea that this project would comprise of multiple pipelines and dataflows that would **Mix** data from various sources. Luckily, we did not adopt the name
blender. For more information on understanding all the components of Mixer, [read here!](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeTrkLia0tVeJ4Li_iEMyGG-cS0xUUHHTUP0quEkgVY/edit#slide=id.g4ba398b299_0_126)

The purpose of this Starter project is to familiarize the end user of this project with the tech stack used here at Cityblock. For those interested in a deeper understanding, suggested reading links will appear
over time, which individuals may opt in to read. The chapters are ordered in sequence and build on one another. Over time we will have a solutions section, in case you may want to skip over
chapters and continue building on.

This guide starts with Chapter 1, where we walk through setting up your local environment which includes setting up your git repository and IDE. You may also
ALl subsequent chapters assume you have set up everything.

In this project you will cover:

1. Working with terraform
1. Writing and Reading from Pub/Sub Queue
1. Coding data pipelines in Scio
1. Dockerize build jobs
1. Running airflow to orchestrate code

This project will be broken down into a number of different chapters for individuals to navigate to. Each chapter will cover separate parts of the data pipeline and will focus on a core technology or principle used
here at Cityblock.
